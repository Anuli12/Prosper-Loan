# Prosper-Loan
Prosper Marketplace, Inc. is a company in the financial services sector located in San Francisco, California. It owns a subsidiary called Prosper Funding LLC, which runs an online platform called Prosper.com. This platform enables individuals to apply for personal loans, credit cards, or invest in loans. The dataset for Prosper Loans comprises 113,937 rows and 81 variables. It encompasses various details such as the loan's current status, investors, credit ratings, the service fees paid by investors, and many others. My analysis of the dataset focused on 8 variables out of the entire dataset.  The set of 8 variables that I analyzed comprised ProsperRating (numeric), ProsperRating (alpha), Loan Status, Borrower APR, Debt-to-Income Ratio, Employment Status, Loan Amount, and Monthly Income.
# Key Insights
After analyzing the loan data provided by Prosper loan, several key findings have emerged. The lender primarily provides loans ranging from $1,000 to $25,000, with a lack of significant loan records above $25,000. This suggests that the lender may specialize in providing smaller loans to borrowers.

Another finding is that borrowers with higher Prosper ratings tend to receive larger loans than those with lower ratings. This is evidenced by the increasing median Loan Original Amount with higher ratings, as well as the greater variability in loan amounts offered to borrowers with higher ratings.

A negative relationship has also been observed between monthly income and Prosper rating. Higher monthly income tends to be associated with lower Prosper ratings. This could imply that borrowers with higher Prosper ratings may have lower incomes. However, the presence of outliers in the data may warrant further examination to determine their impact on the relationship between monthly income and Prosper rating.
The analysis also revealed a relationship between Prosper ratings and loan performance. Loans with higher Prosper ratings have a higher percentage of loans in good standing, while lower Prosper ratings have a significant proportion of loans that are charged off. This suggests that Prosper rating can be a useful predictive feature for loan status.

Furthermore, as the Prosper rating increases, there is a decrease in the interquartile range of the borrower APR. This trend indicates that the distribution of APRs becomes more concentrated around the median as borrower creditworthiness improves. However, outliers in certain Prosper rating categories may warrant further investigation.

Finally, borrowers with lower Prosper ratings tend to have higher DTI ratios, while those with higher ratings tend to have lower ratios. Borrowers with Prosper ratings of AA, E, and HR exhibited the lowest DTI ratios, while those with ratings of C, B, A, and D tended to have higher ratios. These findings suggest that lenders perceive borrowers with higher Prosper ratings as less risky and are therefore more willing to offer them favorable loan terms. The analysis highlights the usefulness of a borrower's Prosper rating as a predictive feature of their DTI ratio.
